# Hey there!
I’m **Exly**, an animator and programmer based in Romania. I enjoy combining visuals and code to build interactive, game-inspired experiences.

# What I do
- Develop gameplay systems and tools using Luau (Roblox)
- Script prototypes, utilities, and small projects in Python
- Explore lower-level and object-oriented concepts with C++ and Java
- Experiment with animation, game logic, and creative coding
# Interests
- The Touhou Project (probably a bit too much)
- Vocaloid and music-driven projects
- Learning new languages, engines, and tools related to game development
