# Hey there
I’m Exly, an animator and programmer from Romania. I love blending visuals and code to create interactive, game-inspired experiences.

# Background
I started animating at age 8 using Source Filmmaker (SFM), inspired by FNAF fan animations. About four years ago, I began coding with Roblox scripting (Luau), then expanded into Python for tools and automation. Lately, I’ve been exploring C++ and Java, all while juggling high school and personal game dev projects.

# What I do
- Develop gameplay systems and tools using Luau (Roblox)
- Script prototypes, utilities, and small projects in Python (especially automating tasks in games I play)
- Explore lower-level and object-oriented concepts with C++ and Java
- Experiment with animation, game logic, and creative coding

# Interests
- The Touhou Project (probably a bit too much)
- Vocaloid and music-driven projects
- Big FNAF fan (started my animation journey here)
- Project Moon games
- Learning new languages, engines, and tools related to game development
