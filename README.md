#Hey there
I’m Exly, an animator and programmer based in Romania. I enjoy combining visuals and code to build interactive, game-inspired experiences.

# Background
Started animating at age 8 using Source Filmmaker (SFM), inspired by FNAF fan animations. Began coding about 4 years ago with Roblox scripting in Luau, then expanded to Python for tools and automation. Now exploring C++ and Java while balancing high school studies with personal game dev projects.

#What I do
- Develop gameplay systems and tools using Luau (Roblox)
- Script prototypes, utilities, and small projects in Python (especially automating tasks in games I play)
- Explore lower-level and object-oriented concepts with C++ and Java
- Experiment with animation, game logic, and creative coding
- 
# Interests
- The Touhou Project (probably a bit too much)
- Vocaloid and music-driven projects
- Big FNAF fan (started my animation journey here)
- Project Moon games
- Learning new languages, engines, and tools related to game development
